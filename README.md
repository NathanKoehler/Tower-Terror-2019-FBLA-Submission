# Unity-FBLA-Game-Code
All the code used for the 2018 FBLA Game - 7th at GA State Conference

---- GENERAL INFO ----
This game was solely coded in C## over the course of several months. I was still learning C## and much of the code is not optomized.

The code was particularly designed to be judged off its readability per say, but many of the scripts contain similar organization.

  The code is seperated into parts like "Methods", indicating methods of the class.
  
  Coroutines, which allow real-time computing in Unity, are seperated into categories.
  
  Get and Set methods were used in certain occasions, usually for debugging purposes and were not removed due to constant testing.
  
  The beginning of certain classes have code that designates the class as a "singleton", meaning that class can only be instanced once.
  
  The code contains two different ways it references other objects, through code and unity's built in inferface methods.
  
The code was intended for Unity 2018.3.6f1 Personal. It has not been optimized for newer or older versions.

---- REDISTRIBUTION ----
